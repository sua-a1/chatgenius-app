# RAG System Versioning Implementation Changes

## Database Schema Updates

### 1. Message Embeddings Table Updates (20240321000030_update_message_embeddings_versioning.sql)
- Added version tracking columns:
  - `version` (integer, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 1)
  - `is_latest` (boolean, NOT NULL, DEFAULT true)
  - `replaced_at` (timestamptz)
  - `original_message_content` (text, NOT NULL)
- Created unique index `message_embeddings_latest_version_idx` to ensure only one latest version per message

### 2. Soft Delete Implementation (20240321000032_add_soft_delete.sql)
- Added soft delete columns:
  - `is_deleted` (boolean, NOT NULL, DEFAULT false)
  - `deleted_at` (timestamptz)
- Created partial index on `is_deleted` for performance optimization

## Trigger Functions

### 1. Message Update Handler
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_message_update()
```
- Checks if content has changed
- Marks existing embedding as not latest
- Queues message for new embedding generation

### 2. Message Delete Handler
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_message_delete()
```
- Implements soft delete for embeddings
- Sets `is_deleted = true` and `deleted_at` to current timestamp
- Marks embeddings as not latest

## Search Function Updates

### 1. Updated Search Messages Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION search_messages()
```
- Added filtering conditions:
  - `me.is_latest = true`
  - `NOT me.is_deleted`
- Maintains existing workspace and privacy filters
- Preserves similarity threshold functionality

## Edge Function Updates

### 1. Generate Embeddings Function
- Updated to include `original_message_content` when storing embeddings
- Maintains existing error handling and logging
- Located in: `functions/generate-embeddings/index.ts`

### 2. Test Embeddings Function
- Added `original_message_content` field to embedding storage
- Updated metadata structure
- Located in: `functions/test-embeddings/index.ts`

### 3. Process Pending Embeddings Script
- Modified to include `original_message_content` in embedding records
- Updated in: `scripts/process-pending-embeddings.ts`

## Migration Order
1. Run versioning migration (20240321000030)
2. Run soft delete migration (20240321000032)
3. Run search function update (20240321000031)

## Key Features Implemented
1. Version tracking for message embeddings
2. Soft delete functionality
3. Automatic versioning on message updates
4. Performance-optimized search queries
5. Preservation of embedding history

## Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Existing embeddings are preserved
- Search performance is optimized with appropriate indexes
- Error handling and logging are maintained throughout 

## Search Function Improvements (2024-03-22)

### 1. User Data Integration
- Fixed issue with user data not displaying in search results
- Modified `search_messages` function to include complete user profile information
- Enhanced context handling in search results

### 2. Context Management Updates
- Improved context passing in chat completion function
- Fixed hallucination issues with user data
- Enhanced vector store setup for more accurate search results

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Improved query efficiency for user data retrieval
- Enhanced embedding context preservation
- Updated search result ranking to better handle user context

## Testing Notes
- Verified user data appears correctly in search results
- Confirmed context preservation across chat sessions
- Validated improved search accuracy with user data integration 

## User Context Improvements (2024-03-XX)

### Message Analysis & User Context
1. Enhanced first-person reference detection in `analyzeQuery`
   - Now properly detects "I", "me", "my", "mine" references
   - Immediately converts first-person references to current username
   - Ensures consistent user filtering across all query types

2. Improved User Context Propagation
   - Updated user info passing from frontend route to Edge Function
   - Added proper user profile fetching from database instead of relying on user_metadata
   - Ensured username is correctly passed through the entire RAG pipeline

3. Search Text Generation
   - Added user-specific context in semantic search text generation
   - Improved search text for user-specific queries (e.g., "messages sent by username")
   - Better handling of user context in non-aggregation queries

4. Filter Improvements
   - Enhanced user filtering in `getRelevantMessages`
   - Added proper logging of username filters
   - Consistent username cleaning and validation

### Impact
- Fixed issues with first-person queries (e.g., "What did I send in channel Side")
- Improved accuracy of message retrieval for user-specific queries
- More reliable handling of user context across different query types
- Better semantic search results for user-specific content
