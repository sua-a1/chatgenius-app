# AI Assistant Query Best Practices

## Introduction
This guide helps you formulate effective queries for the ChatGenius AI assistant to get the most relevant and helpful responses.

## Query Structure

### 1. Basic Query Components
- **Context**: Background information
- **Action**: What you want to accomplish
- **Scope**: Specific area or timeframe
- **Format**: Desired response format

### 2. Query Templates

#### General Format
```
[Context] + [Action Required] + [Specific Details] + [Expected Output]
```

#### Examples
```
"Given our recent performance optimization work [Context], 
explain the changes made to the message loading system [Action] 
in the past week [Scope], 
focusing on the impact on database queries [Specific Details]."
```

## Query Types and Examples

### 1. Information Retrieval
```
✅ "What are the key features implemented in the messaging system during Sprint 23?"
❌ "What happened in the last sprint?"

✅ "Show me all discussions about database optimization from the backend team this month."
❌ "Find database stuff."
```

### 2. Technical Explanations
```
✅ "Explain how our vector search implementation handles message embeddings, specifically the similarity threshold configuration."
❌ "How does search work?"

✅ "Walk me through the real-time message update process, focusing on the subscription handling."
❌ "Tell me about updates."
```

### 3. Problem Solving
```
✅ "I'm seeing slow message loading in the thread view. What recent changes might be affecting performance?"
❌ "Why is it slow?"

✅ "Help me debug the authentication flow by checking recent error logs and configuration changes."
❌ "Fix auth please."
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Context Enrichment
```
✅ "Based on our current codebase structure and the recent migration to TypeScript,
suggest the best approach for implementing the new message threading feature."

✅ "Considering our existing database schema and the need for real-time updates,
what's the optimal way to implement message reactions?"
```

### 2. Comparative Queries
```
✅ "Compare the performance implications of using WebSocket vs. HTTP polling
for our real-time message updates, considering our current user scale."

✅ "Analyze the trade-offs between storing message history in PostgreSQL vs.
using a dedicated document store, focusing on our specific usage patterns."
```

### 3. Multi-part Queries
```
✅ "First, show me the current implementation of message threading.
Then, identify potential performance bottlenecks.
Finally, suggest optimization strategies."

✅ "1. Explain our current approach to handling message attachments
2. List any scalability concerns
3. Propose improvements for handling large files"
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Vague Queries
```
❌ "How does it work?"
✅ "Explain how the message queuing system handles high-volume traffic during peak hours."

❌ "Is this good?"
✅ "Evaluate the current database indexing strategy for message searches in terms of query performance."
```

### 2. Overly Broad Queries
```
❌ "Tell me everything about the project."
✅ "Provide an overview of the key messaging features implemented in the last quarter."

❌ "What should I know?"
✅ "What are the critical configuration settings for setting up the real-time messaging system?"
```

### 3. Contextless Queries
```
❌ "Fix the bug."
✅ "Help me diagnose and fix the message duplication issue occurring during real-time updates."

❌ "Why isn't it working?"
✅ "Why are message notifications not being delivered when users are mentioned in threads?"
```

## Tips for Success

### 1. Be Specific
- Include relevant technical details
- Specify time periods when applicable
- Reference specific features or components
- Mention related systems or dependencies

### 2. Provide Context
- Reference previous discussions
- Include error messages
- Mention related changes
- Describe expected behavior

### 3. Structure Complex Queries
- Break down into smaller parts
- Use numbered lists for multiple questions
- Prioritize important aspects
- Specify desired level of detail

## Response Optimization

### 1. Format Requests
```
✅ "List the top 5 performance bottlenecks in our message processing pipeline,
ordered by impact, with specific metrics for each."

✅ "Provide a step-by-step guide for implementing message encryption,
including code examples and security considerations."
```

### 2. Scope Control
```
✅ "Focus on the database layer when explaining our message search implementation,
excluding frontend and API considerations for now."

✅ "Limit the analysis to user authentication flows implemented in the last month,
specifically those affecting message permissions."
```

### 3. Follow-up Refinement
```
✅ "Based on your previous explanation of the caching system,
dive deeper into how we handle cache invalidation for edited messages."

✅ "Expanding on the websocket implementation discussion,
explain how we manage connection pooling for optimal performance."
