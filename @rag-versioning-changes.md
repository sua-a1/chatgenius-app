# RAG System Changes

## Session: Workspace Access and Channel Query Fixes

1. Fixed workspace access in `context-assembly.ts`:
   - Updated Supabase client initialization to properly handle service role auth
   - Added proper auth headers:
     ```typescript
     {
       Authorization: `Bearer ${serviceRoleKey}`,
       'x-supabase-auth-user-id': user_id,
       'x-supabase-auth-role': 'service_role'
     }
     ```
   - Removed unnecessary `persistSession` and `autoRefreshToken` settings

2. Updated `search_messages` function in database:
   - Added service role bypass for workspace access checks:
     ```sql
     if auth.role() <> 'service_role' then
       -- Verify workspace access
     end if;
     ```
   - Added service role bypass for channel access checks:
     ```sql
     and (
       auth.role() = 'service_role'
       or exists (
         -- Channel access check
       )
     )
     ```

3. Fixed channel query in `enrichContextWithMetadata`:
   - Removed non-existent `is_deleted` column check from channels query
   - Simplified channel query to only filter by workspace_id and channel IDs:
     ```typescript
     .from('channels')
     .select('id, name')
     .in('id', channelIds)
     .eq('workspace_id', workspace_id)
     ```

4. Improved error handling:
   - Added proper error logging for channel and user queries
   - Added appropriate empty result returns for different query types
   - Maintained proper type safety throughout the changes

These changes resolved:
- Workspace access denied errors by properly handling service role auth
- Channel query errors by removing non-existent column checks
- Improved overall error handling and logging
